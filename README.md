## Hyderabad Metro Navigator
The Hyderabad Metro Navigator is a Java-based console application designed to assist users in navigating the Hyderabad Metro Rail network. It provides key functionalities such as finding the shortest path between stations based on distance or time, estimating fare, and listing all available stations. This project simulates a metro navigation system to offer an interactive experience to users and provides useful information about travel routes within the Hyderabad Metro network.

## Features
1.List All Stations - Displays all available stations in the Hyderabad Metro Rail network.

2.Shortest Distance Calculation - Calculates the shortest distance between two specified stations.

3.Shortest Time Calculation - Calculates the shortest time required to travel between two specified stations.

4.Fare Estimation - Provides fare estimates for traveling between two stations.

5.Shortest Path (Distance) - Displays the shortest path between two stations based on distance.

6.Shortest Path (Time) - Displays the shortest path between two stations based on travel time.

## Project Structure
The project includes:

1.Graph Implementation - Uses an adjacency list to represent the metro stations and connections.

2.Data Models - Utilizes a custom Edge class to represent each metro line with source, destination, distance, and time properties.

3.Stations Map - A map of station IDs and names, enabling easier navigation and route selection.

4.Dijkstra's Algorithm - Applied to calculate the shortest distance and time between stations.

## Getting Started

1.Clone the repository - git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hyderabad-Metro-Navigator.git

2.Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).

3.Compile and run the HydMetro.java file.


## Example
****WELCOME TO THE HYDERABAD METRO*****
1. LIST ALL THE STATIONS IN THE MAP
2. GET SHORTEST DISTANCE FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
3. GET SHORTEST TIME TO REACH FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
4. GET FARE TO TRAVEL FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
5. GET SHORTEST PATH (DISTANCE WISE) TO REACH FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
6. GET SHORTEST PATH (TIME WISE) TO REACH FROM A 'SOURCE' STATION TO 'DESTINATION' STATION
7. EXIT THE MENU
